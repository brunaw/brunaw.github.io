      <description>Introduction Decision trees ensembles are a very popular type of machine learning algorithm, which is mostly due to their adaptive nature, high prediction power and, in some sense, interpretability. Random Forests are one form of such ensembles, and they consist of growing many trees in re-samples of the data, and averaging their results at end, creating a bagged ensemble described [@Breiman1996] by
\[\begin{equation} \hat f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N_{tree}} \frac{1}{N_{tree}} \hat f_n(\mathbf{x}), \end{equation}\]</description>

      <description>*Portuguese version of this same post here!
On a daily basis, I come across people on Facebook groups, Telegram or Twitter having troubles with some tasks in R. These problems have two main origins:
difficulties in constructing the algorithm to reach the desired result. difficulties in understanding the behavior of some function.  The focus of this post is to give some notion about how to solve the second one: problems using functions.</description>
